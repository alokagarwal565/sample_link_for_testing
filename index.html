        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-10 text-gray-800">Frequently Asked Questions about AI</h1>

        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <div class="mb-8 p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg border border-blue-200">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-800">1. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-blue-700">
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. AI encompasses various sub-fields, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, all aimed at enabling machines to perform tasks that typically require human cognitive abilities.

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="mb-8 p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg border border-green-200">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-green-800">2. How does Machine Learning relate to AI?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-green-700">
                Machine Learning (ML) is a fundamental subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms allowing computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of hard-coding rules, ML models are trained on large datasets, enabling them to identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time. This learning capability is crucial for many AI applications, from recommendation systems and predictive analytics to autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis, making ML a core component of modern AI systems.

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div class="mb-8 p-6 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg border border-purple-200">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-purple-800">3. What are some common applications of AI in daily life?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-purple-700">
                AI is increasingly integrated into our daily lives, often without us even realizing it. Common applications include virtual personal assistants like Siri and Alexa, which use natural language processing to understand and respond to voice commands. Recommendation systems on platforms like Netflix and Amazon leverage AI to suggest content or products based on past behavior. Spam filters in email, facial recognition in smartphones, fraud detection in banking, and navigation apps that optimize routes are other prevalent examples where AI significantly enhances convenience, security, and efficiency.

        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <div class="mb-8 p-6 bg-red-50 rounded-lg border border-red-200">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-red-800">4. What are the main ethical considerations surrounding AI development?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-red-700">
                The rapid advancement of AI brings forth several critical ethical considerations. Key concerns include algorithmic bias, where AI systems can perpetuate or even amplify existing societal biases if trained on unrepresentative or skewed data, leading to unfair outcomes. Privacy is another major issue, as AI often relies on vast amounts of personal data, raising questions about data collection, storage, and usage. Additionally, accountability for AI decisions, the potential for job displacement due to automation, and the responsible development of autonomous systems are significant ethical challenges that require careful consideration and regulation to ensure AI benefits humanity broadly and equitably.

        <!-- Question 5 -->
        <div class="mb-8 p-6 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg border border-yellow-200">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-yellow-800">5. What is the difference between Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Narrow AI?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-yellow-700">
                The primary distinction lies in their scope of capability. Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI, is designed and trained for a specific task, such as playing chess, recognizing faces, or providing recommendations. It excels within its defined domain but cannot perform outside of it. In contrast, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), or Strong AI, refers to a hypothetical type of AI that possesses human-like cognitive abilities, capable of understanding, learning, and applying intelligence across a wide range of tasks and domains, much like a human being. While Narrow AI is prevalent today, AGI remains a subject of ongoing research and development.

        <!-- Question 6 -->
        <div class="mb-8 p-6 bg-indigo-50 rounded-lg border border-indigo-200">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-indigo-800">6. What is the potential future impact of AI on society?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-indigo-700">
                The future impact of AI on society is expected to be transformative, influencing nearly every sector. In healthcare, AI could revolutionize diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized treatment plans. In education, it might offer adaptive learning experiences tailored to individual student needs. Economically, AI could boost productivity and create new industries, though it also poses challenges related to job displacement and income inequality. Furthermore, AI could play a crucial role in addressing global challenges like climate change and resource management through advanced data analysis and optimization. However, realizing these benefits will depend heavily on responsible development, ethical governance, and equitable access to AI technologies.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-teal-700">
                AI is significantly accelerating advancements across various scientific disciplines by enabling researchers to process, analyze, and interpret vast amounts of complex data more efficiently than ever before. In biology and medicine, AI assists in protein folding prediction, genomics analysis, and identifying potential drug candidates. In physics, it helps in simulating complex phenomena and analyzing experimental data from particle accelerators. For climate science, AI models can predict weather patterns, analyze climate data, and optimize energy consumption.

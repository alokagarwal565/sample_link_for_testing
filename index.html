        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <div class="mb-8 p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg border border-blue-200">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-800">1. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-blue-700">
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. AI encompasses various sub-fields, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, all aimed at enabling machines to perform tasks that typically require human cognitive abilities.

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="mb-8 p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg border border-green-200">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-green-800">2. How does Machine Learning relate to AI?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-green-700">
                Machine Learning (ML) is a fundamental subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms allowing computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of hard-coding rules, ML models are trained on large datasets, enabling them to identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time. This learning capability is crucial for many AI applications, from recommendation systems and predictive analytics to autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis, making ML a core component of modern AI systems.

        <!-- New Question 3 -->
        <div class="p-6 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg border border-purple-200">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-purple-800">3. What are some common applications of AI in daily life?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-purple-700">
                AI is increasingly integrated into our daily lives, often without us even realizing it. Common applications include virtual personal assistants like Siri and Alexa, which use natural language processing to understand and respond to voice commands. Recommendation systems on platforms like Netflix and Amazon leverage AI to suggest content or products based on past behavior. Spam filters in email, facial recognition in smartphones, fraud detection in banking, and navigation apps that optimize routes are other prevalent examples where AI significantly enhances convenience, security, and efficiency.
